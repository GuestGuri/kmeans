# kmeans
A dirty implementation of K-means clusturing algorithm in Python
2 options are given to test and evaluate the algorithm: 
1/ Test with random sample of data (choose the length of the sample and the dimension of every data point)
2/ Test with the given Iris dataset
In both cases, you must fix the number of clusters (k value) and the stop criteria.
